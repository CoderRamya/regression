### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- Maven 3.8 or higher
- SQLite 3 (or your preferred database)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kenya-jug/regression.git
   cd regression
   ```

2. **Configure the database**
   - SQLite database will be automatically created in the project directory
   - Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your database configuration:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlite:regression.db
     spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.sqlite.JDBC
     ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### Docker Deployment

1. **Build the Docker image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t regression .
   ```

2. **Run the container**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 regression
   ```

### API Documentation

Once the application is running, you can access the API documentation at:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`
- OpenAPI Specification: `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SERVER_PORT` | Port to run the application | 8080 |
| `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` | Active Spring profile | dev |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key for JWT tokens | (required in production) |

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter database issues, ensure you have write permissions in the project directory
- For port conflicts, change the `SERVER_PORT` environment variable
- Check the application logs for detailed error messages

### Development Workflow

1. **Running Tests**
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

2. **Code Style Check**
   ```bash
   mvn checkstyle:check
   ```

3. **Generating Documentation**
   ```bash
   mvn javadoc:javadoc
   ```

### Contributing

1. Create a new branch for your feature
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```

3. Push your changes and create a pull request
